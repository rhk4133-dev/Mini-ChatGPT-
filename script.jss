Create a fully working offline mini chatbot using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Important rules (do not break these):
Do NOT use any API, backend, server, or API key.
The chatbot must reply using pure JavaScript logic (if/else or keyword matching).
Split the project into three separate files:
index.html
style.css
script.js
The chatbot must:
Reply to “hi”, “hello”, “how are you”, “help”, “bye”
Give random replies for unknown messages
Support Enter key to send messages
Scroll automatically
UI must look clean, modern, and mobile-friendly (dark theme).
Do not pretend it is real ChatGPT or AI.
Output the complete code for all three files, clearly separated and ready to upload to GitHub Pages.
